/*
Package main includes call for the Create Go App CLI.

Create a new production-ready project with backend (Golang),
frontend (JavaScript, TypeScript) and deploy automation
(Ansible, Docker) by running one CLI command.

-> Focus on writing code and thinking of business logic!
<- The Create Go App CLI will take care of the rest.

A helpful documentation and next steps -> https://create-go.app/
